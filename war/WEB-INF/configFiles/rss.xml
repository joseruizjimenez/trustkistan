		<description>Summer time, it's really hot out there and I have way too many free hours, so... Why not? a summer project! 
			The idea was to take my tiny experience making webs and actually make one to a real 'production' state. That meant looking for a hosting service and since this project was mainly build a JavaEE Project, it became really hard to find a cheap hosting. 
			Soo... that's how Google App Engine became a nice option. For some features I use you have to enable the payment option but its a really cheap service. If this site gets tons of traffic and free quota get fulfilled I wouldn't mind to pay a few bucks lol 

			Well... I will be writting about several topics, from kinda-geek tech to music. Welcome!</description>
